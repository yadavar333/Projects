## About the Project

Minesweeper is a logic puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. This project recreates the classic game, allowing users to test their logic skills and reaction speed.

## Game Rules

1. The game board consists of a grid of cells, some containing mines.
2. The playerâ€™s goal is to uncover all cells that do not contain mines.
3. If a player clicks on a cell with a mine, the game is over.
4. Uncovered cells display a number indicating how many neighboring cells contain mines. This clue helps players deduce safe cells.
5. Players can flag cells they suspect contain mines to keep track.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid Size and Difficulty:** Select from easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels, or set your own grid size and mine count.
- **Timer:** Track the time taken to complete each game.
- **Flagging Mechanism:** Right-click to flag cells you suspect contain mines.
- **Scoreboard:** High score tracking to challenge yourself or others.
- **Game Restart:** Easily reset the game and try again with one click.

## Technologies

This project uses:

- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for graphics and user interaction.

## Usage

1. Start the game by running the main script.
2. Select the difficulty level or customize the board size and mine count.
3. Use left-click to uncover a cell.
4. Right-click to place a flag on a suspected mine.
5. Continue playing until all non-mine cells are uncovered or you hit a mine!
